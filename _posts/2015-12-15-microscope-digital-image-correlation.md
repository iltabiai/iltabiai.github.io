   A small dogbone specimen containing one unique fiber is prepared in such a way that its surface provides a good enough level of grey in order to do Digital Image Correlation without the need of an additional speckle pattern.
   The purpose of the experiment is to evaluate the deformation field and observed damage mechanisms around the fiber (\\(100 \mu m diameter\\)) while the specimen is experiencing quasi-static tensile load.

   The specimen is loaded in a microtraction machine adapted to perform the test under the microscope's lens.

   The test is stopped 8 times in order to take pictures using the amazing **Olympus OLS4100 laser confocal microscope**, it provides us with height information for each pixel and sweeps through a range of the z-height to provide a crisp clear definition at every corner of the picture.
