Colper Science a bi-weekly podcast about Open Science and its methods. Each episode is an interview with someone somewhoe related to Open Science. We believe that is today possible for researchers to fully migrate to the world of Open Science using tools and methods already available out there, but  most of these tools, methods and possibilities remain unknown by most of the research community. Colper Science's purpose is to let everybody know about these tools by sharing success stories around Open Science.
