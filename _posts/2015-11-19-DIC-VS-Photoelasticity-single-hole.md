A transparent photoelastic polymer containing a single hole of 500um is loaded under tensile stress. The same experiment is done again using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) as an analysis method this time.
The contour plot shown in the DIC experiment are percentiles of (e1-e2), where e1 is the deformation in the first principal direction and e2 the deformation in the second principal direction. The number of photoelastic fringes passing through a material point on the specimen's surface is also proportional to (e1-e2), allowing comparison of both methods.
This video compares both methods.
Both specimens' dimensions were chosen according to the ASTM D632 Type V.
Test speed: 0.1mm/min

Experiments done in collaboration with Rolland Delorme, at Ecole Polytechnique Montreal in November 2015.
