A transparent photoelastic polymer containing a single hole of \\(500\mum\\) is loaded under tensile stress. The same experiment is done again using *Digital Image Correlation* (DIC) as an analysis method this time.
The contour plot shown in the DIC experiment are percentiles of \\(\epsilon_e1-\epsilon_2\\), where \\(\epsilon_1\\) is the deformation in the first principal direction and \\(\epsilon_2\\) the deformation in the second principal direction. The number of photoelastic fringes passing through a material point on the specimen's surface is also proportional to \\(\epsilon_e1-\epsilon_2\\), allowing a qualitative comparison of both methods by looking at:
* The fring concentration
* The number of fringes passing through a single material point and their direciton
This video compares both methods.

Both specimens' dimensions were chosen according to the [ASTM D632 Type V](http://www.astm.org/Standards/D638.htm).
Test speed: \\(0.1mm/min\\)

Experiments done in collaboration with Rolland Delorme, at Ecole Polytechnique Montreal during November 2015.
