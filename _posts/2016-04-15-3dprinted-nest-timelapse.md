   Simply sharing a timelapse of a 18 hours print. The part is the _Bird Feeder_, designed by [Printed nest](www.printednest.com). The print was done on a _Leapfrog Creatr_, with a layer height of 0.3mm and 80% infill. The Printed Nest team recommends a 100% infill but I try to avoid printing 100% infill parts on printer that are not equipped with an active cooling system (which is the case of the _Leapfrog Creatr_), else it is necessary to print very slowly in order to let the previous 100% layer cool down before laying the next one on it.

    The filament I used is from the *PLA Opaque Series*. Affordable, no knots in the spool, it flows great, the color is good enough an they have several afety certificatons on their Material Saety Data Sheet. If you woul like t get some, take a look at [3D-TRIP](www.3dtrip.ca) or even more intereting prices around the Montreal area.
