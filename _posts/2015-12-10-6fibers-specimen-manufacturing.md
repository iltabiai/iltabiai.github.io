   A 3D-printed mold was designed to hold 6 steel fibers (basically steel wire of 900\\(mu m\\) arranged in two parallel lines of 3 fibers. 
Epoxy is then poured in the mold and cures around the fibers. The mold is then horizontally cut to provide several dogbone specimen, containing transversally embedded steel fibers.

   One of the specimens was polished, then *covered with photoelastic film* on the front and back to reveal the photoelastic properties of Epoxy.
Other surfaces were covered with black ink to avoid non-polarized light diminushing the contrast of polarized light.
It is then possible to qualitatively see the residual stresses in the specimen due to *cooling* after curing and the *mismatch of coefficient of thermal expansion* between the fibers and the matrix.

   The density of **fringes** (isolines of same colours) qualitatively shows the stress concentration. The more colours there are in an area, the higher the stress concentration is.
It is possible to distinguish the residual stresses due to the interaction with the mold and the residual stress around each fiber.
