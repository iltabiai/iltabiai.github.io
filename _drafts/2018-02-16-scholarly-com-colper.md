McGill will celebrated the Open Access Week International (October 23-29 2-17) with events designed to bring awareness to newer aspects of the scholarly communication lifecycle. Vincent Larivière, Canada Research Chair in the Transformations of Scholarly Communication and associate professor of information science at the École de bibliothéconomie et des sciences de l'information (l’Université de Montréal) gave a talk entitled _“Scholarly communication and open access: what researchers should know”_.

The [complete presentation is available here](http://tiny.cc/colper-lariviere) and we recommend that you take a look at the slides while listening to the first half of this episode, which is the first section of Vincent Larivière's presentation. We will discover how publishing in researcher became what it is today and an explanation of how having five big companies dominate this field affects researchers.

In the second part of this episode, we will present a short interview we had with Vincent Lariviere about an interesting event which happened here, at Université de Montreal, during the summer of 2017: the library’s university refused to renew one of the big deals it had with Taylor and Francis Group and had to go through tough negotiations with the publisher. Vinvent Lariviere was part of these negotiation and will tell us a little bit more about the role he played there.
